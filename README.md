# **Card Clash**

Card Clash is an fast-paced strategy game where players engage in card-based battles, using their wit and tactics to outmaneuver opponents. Each player is dealt a hand of unique cards, including power-ups, that can dramatically change the outcome of each round. The objective is simple: outscore your opponent after 8 rounds of play to claim victory.

This project was developed as part of a group assignment during my B.Tech at Dayananda Sagar University. We used the Pygame library to handle the graphics and game logic. The project was a collaborative effort with my teammates Prajwal, Sharath, and Rishab.

## **Key Features**

**Strategic Card Play**: Each player is dealt 10 cards—8 normal cards and 2 power-up cards. Use these strategically to outmaneuver your opponent.

**Power-Up Cards**: Unleash powerful abilities with 4 unique power-up cards that can change the course of the game.

**Fast-Paced Gameplay**: Each game consists of 8 rounds, and the player with the highest score at the end wins.

**Single-Player Mode**: Play against the AI.


## **Gameplay**

### **Rules**

Both the player and the computer are dealt 10 cards—8 normal cards and 2 power-up cards.
Players take turns playing a card each round.
The winner of the round scores 1 point, and in case of a draw, neither player scores.
The game ends after 8 rounds, and the player with the highest score wins.

### **Power-Up Cards**

There are 4 distinct power-up cards in Card Clash:

**Divine Eyes**: This card allows the user to see the card being played by the opponent and select their card accordingly.

**Exchange**: Swap the card you're about to play with the opponent's card. This round doesn't count as a round.

**Challenge**: Double the stakes—this card gives 2 points to the winner of the round. In case of a draw, neither player scores.

**Reverse**: Reverse the result of the round. The loser of the round gets 1 point instead of the winner.
